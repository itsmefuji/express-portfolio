        <h3>HOME MONITOR with an ARDUINO UNO</h3>

            In my first semester at Georgian College, I took an program class where where we used an Arduino Uno to create whatever we
            desired. So I decided to make a simple Home Monitoring System where the Arduino notified you on a specific IP
            address if the sensor was triggered.
            <br>
            <br> The idea came from a youtube video I watched by <a href="https://www.openhomeautomation.net">Open Home Automation</a>
            and I was instantly interested due to how I am very interested in Security and Coding. The hardware build was
            very simple due to the fact that I did not use any shielding device to protect the Arduino.

            I had a hard time on the software side however, with the support of our professor, Ross Bigelow, I was able to program my
            Arduino with no errors. I had a external Git Repository avaliable for use, however, I decided to only use the
            repository as a reference only to keep the project challenging.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a first year, first semester student, I felt that I did a very successful job as I received a 95% on the project and passed the course with a 93%.
            If I were to do this project again, I would incoorperate my new coding skills and use not only a push sensor, but with various sensors
            that could email or text me when the sensors were triggered.
